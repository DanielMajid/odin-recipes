<p>I seem to spend a lot of time thinking about Isfahan these days, so I started searching online and paging through cookbooks for inspiration to see what intriguing and tasty dish I could come up with to share. This is a simple Isfahani stew that features familiar elements such as lamb, chickpeas (in this case, in the form of flour), tomatoes, and spices, combined in a unique and surprising manner to create an extraordinary flavor profile and texture.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, ground</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric, ground</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>4 medium ripe tomatoes, or 14 oz canned diced tomatoes</li>
<li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>1 sprig fresh mint, for garnish</li>
<h4>Meatballs</h4>
<li>>1/2 cup chickpea flour</li>
<li>1 pound ground lamb, or beef</li>
<li>1 medium onion, grated</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, ground</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried mint</li>
<li>1 teaspoon turmeric, ground</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin, ground</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ginger, powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cloves, ground</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4></ol>
<ol>
<li>In a large Dutch oven, saute the onions with olive oil on medium heat for about 10 minutes or until lightly golden.</li>
<li>Add salt, pepper, turmeric, mint, and bay leaves and saute for 2 additional minutes.</li>
<li>Add tomatoes, tomato paste, and water. Cover and bring to a gentle simmer before reducing the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Combine all the ingredients for the meatballs with the exception of the oil. Gently knead to mix and combine the spices into the meatballs. Meatballs should not be dry and crumbly. If so, add 1-2 tablespoons of water to adjust the texture.</li>
<li>In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and begin sauteing the meatballs, rotating them a few times.</li>
<li>Saute the meatballs for 10 minutes to bring out the flavor and color. Meatballs should become colorful, aromatic, and visibly sauteed (but not fully cooked).</li>
<li>Add the sauteed meatballs to the sauce, cover, and cook over low heat for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Garnish the stew with fresh mint and serve over steamed basmati rice.</li>
