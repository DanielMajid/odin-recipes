    <p>Khoresh Bamieh originates from the Khuzestan province in southern Iran, where it is traditionally prepared with tamarind sauce. However, this variety, more common elsewhere in Iran, substitutes tomato sauce for the lesser-known tamarind.</p>
    <p>  Okra, or bamieh in Persian, comes with its own share of controversy. “Oh, not another one,” you say! Okra’s flavor profile is often compared to that of eggplant, and it has both fans and detractors, with strong opinions on both sides. It can develop an unpleasant texture if not properly prepared, with a tendency to become slippery and gooey. Can you tell I’m trying very hard to avoid saying “slimy”?</p>
    <p>But with a pinch of knowledge and a spoonful of care, this challenge can be overcome. When okra is cut and its cell walls are exposed, it releases a sticky substance that many find off-putting. To avoid this, buy smaller okra and cook them whole. If you need to slice them, make sure the pieces are larger. Cook them with sufficient oil at a higher temperature, avoid overcrowding the pan, and stir them sparingly.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>    
    <li>1 pound whole okra, approximately 20 pieces, stems trimmed</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons neutral oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 onion, diced</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric, ground</li>
    <li>1 pound beef, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup water, more as needed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, adjust to your taste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper, ground</li>
    <li>2-4 tablespoons Ghooreh (unripe sour grapes), or lemon juice as a substitute</li></ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>In a large frying pan, saute the okra with 6 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat for 10 minutes. Stir gently as needed, but avoid over stirring.
<li>Once the okra has been sauteed on all sides and has turned a dark golden color, remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and saute the onions over medium heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the garlic and turmeric, and saute for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the beef, increase the heat to medium-high, and saute for another 2 minutes. Finally, add the tomato paste and stir to combine.</li>
<li>Add 1 cup of water, salt, and pepper and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook the stew over low heat for 75 minutes or until the meat is nearly fork tender.</li>
<li>Return the sauteed okra to the stew, and add tghe Ghooreh.</li>
<li>Cover and cook over low heat for 20 minutes or until the okra has fully cooked.</li>
<li>Adjust the liquid level as needed. The stew should be moist but not watery.</li>
<li>Serve the stew with steamed saffron basmati rice.</li></ol>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>The stew can also be made with lamb or chicken or the meat entirely eliminated to create a vegan dish.  If eliminating the meat, reduce the cooking time by 60 minutes.</p>
