<h3>This dish is the national dish of Iran.</h3> Served with Tahdig and rice it is perhaps, the national dish of all Persian peoples throughout the diaspora. Unlike some other dishes that stir controversy, Gormeh Sabzi is universally beloved for its complex flavors, and its hearty belly-filling nature. For non persians it might be an acquired taste, but give it time. You will see the light. And like any good stew, it only gets more delicious as the days pass since its preparation. Gormeh Sabzi on day three is goated.
